### Overview of the analysis:
A summary dataframe of the ride share fares by city type was created and a line grapsh by week to show how the data differs by city type to be used by decision makers at Pyber.  

### Results:
Urban cities have more rides, 1625, more dirvers, 2405, lower average fares per rides, $24.53, and lower average fares per driver, $16.57. 
Rural citites have fewer rides, 125, fewer drivers, 78, higher average fare per ride, $34.62, and higher fare per driver, $55.49.
Suburban cities fare in the middle for all categories including: total rides, 652; riders per driver, 2405; average fare per ride, $30.97; and average fare per driver, $39.50. See Table below. <img width="660" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-24 at 8 10 20 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82460401/119353252-48447a00-bc68-11eb-9400-f0fbc6e4afbf.png">

According to the line graph below, the amount of fares dropped for all city types especially for uprban and suburban. The last week in February saw a spike in fares for all city types. Only suburban fares spiked the thrid week in March right before the drop.

### Summary:
Based on this analysis three recomendations are provided.
  -1. Further analysis between the average fare and the length of the fare in miles and or time to compare if the difference between city type is due to longer fares or something else. 
  -2. Evaluate the number of urban drivers compared to number of rides. It appears from this data that there are more drivers than rides needed. 
  -3. I would evaluate what if any overlap the suburban drivers have with both urban and rural drivers. 
  
  Additional data is required for this more indepth analysis.
